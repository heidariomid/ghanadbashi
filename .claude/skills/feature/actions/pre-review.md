# Pre-Review Action

**Optional.** Best after `/feature load`, before `/feature start`.
`start` does not wait for this. Skip it when the change is small and the
spec is already clear.

Not `/feature after-review`. Do not lint, build, open the browser, create a
branch, or write the feature. Status stays Not Started.

## 1. Read context

- [project.md](../project.md) — this repo’s Notion parent, who “the client”
  is, production URL. Required for the briefing voice
- @context/current-feature.md — goals and notes
- The spec in @context/features/ or @context/fixes/ if one was loaded
- @context/coding-standards.md
- @context/project-overview.md

If Goals are empty: stop. "Run /feature load first."

## 2. Read the files the spec will touch

Open the current code. Do not rely on memory.

- Pages, components, and data models the spec names
- Existing links, copy, and hooks it says to change
- Helpers it will reuse (lib, actions, config, env)
- Access rules and required fields on those models
- `package.json` — is a named dependency already installed?

Follow an existing pattern in the repo. Do not invent a new one.

## 3. Check platform and framework defaults

When the spec uploads, calls a third party, or depends on a default limit:

- Read current docs for that tool (Next.js, Payload, host, email, etc.)
- Note hard ceilings and defaults that fail before the spec’s own cap

A limit that only appears in production is a must-change.

## 4. Classify findings

| Mark | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| **Must change** | Spec or current code will fail or contradict if implemented as written |
| **Spec amendment** | Small change so the spec matches how it will actually be built |
| **Implementation note** | Easy to miss; no product vote |
| **Do not add** | Out of scope, or extra fields / vendors |

## 5. Save the result to Notion

The write-up is a **team briefing**, not a developer dump. Someone who does
not read the repo should be able to vote. Do **not** paste the findings in
chat.

**Voice.** Short sentences. What happens for the visitor or the client
(names from `project.md`), then why. Define a term the first time it is
not obvious. No file tours, no stack traces, no “see line 40”. One real
example only when it makes the risk obvious.

1. Fetch `notion://docs/enhanced-markdown-spec` and follow it. Do not guess
   Notion markdown.
2. Search Notion using `project.md` (parent + index). Same subject → update.
   None → create under Parent and link from Index.
3. Title from `project.md` title shape + the H1 feature name
4. Page shape:
   - Opening callout: the one thing to remember + the verdict
   - For each must-change / amendment: **what it is now**, **what the
     visitor or the client would see if we ship that**, **why we want a
     change**, **what we recommend**
   - Implementation notes in one short table (dev traps, not votes)
   - Do not add
   - **Votes** as checkboxes the team can tick
5. End with what they should do next (approve the boxes, or start is fine).

Do not implement. Do not edit the spec until the user says the team agreed.

## 6. Pointer in current-feature

Append only this to **Notes** (so `/feature start` can see it ran):

```
Pre-review — [date]
- Verdict: Ready to implement / Needs decisions
- Notion: {url}
```

Leave Goals unchanged until decisions are approved. After the team agrees,
update Goals, Notes, and the spec so implementation follows the new text.

## 7. Chat

Chat is **only**:

- The verdict: **Ready to implement** or **Needs decisions**
- The Notion URL

If a step was skipped, one short clause why. No findings dump.
